Game modes:

Classic

-   The current one
-   Not friendly for mobiles, as it has a large number of cards for a small screen
-   Up to 30 cards displayed at a time
-   Custom or set difficulty, i.e:
    -   Easy: 6 cards only
    -   Normal: 12 cards
    -   Hard: 20 cards
    -   Nightmare: 30 cards

Normal

-   Shows up to 6 cards at once
    -   Rotates cards shown out of the deck until all have been clicked
    -   Easy: Shows 3 cards at once out of 6
    -   Normal: Shows 4 cards at once out of 12
    -   Hard: Shows 5 cards at once out of 20
    -   Nightmare: Shows 6 cards at once out of 30
-   Friendly for mobiles as it has only 6 cards max on the screen
-   Have to be careful with coding this as to make sure there is always at least 1 valid card on screen
    -   Could use an object to store this?
    -   While function to check how many objects in the shuffled array are valid >= 1

Timed
- Every game mode has a timed option
- Different scoring storage
- Better for "prestige"
- Have to hold off on making this a pushed thing/faster until the time mechanism is fixed

useEffect with a setTimeout, and cancel setTimeout and restart it if a card is clicked


Secret levels:

Unown mode
-   Only unown pokemon are shown
-   Hardest difficulty?
-   Unlocked only after every other one has been completed on timed
-   Show that it can be unlocked, but not what it is yet
-   Maybe show via achievements as "?????"
-   Only timed
