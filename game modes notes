Game modes:

Classic

-   The current one
-   Not friendly for mobiles, as it has a large number of cards for a small screen
-   Up to 30 cards displayed at a time
-   Custom or set difficulty, i.e:
    -   Easy: 6 cards only
    -   Normal: 12 cards
    -   Hard: 20 cards
    -   Nightmare: 30 cards

Normal

-   Shows up to 6 cards at once
    -   Rotates cards shown out of the deck until all have been clicked
    -   Easy: Shows 3 cards at once out of 6
    -   Normal: Shows 4 cards at once out of 12
    -   Hard: Shows 5 cards at once out of 20
    -   Nightmare: Shows 6 cards at once out of 30
-   Friendly for mobiles as it has only 6 cards max on the screen
-   Have to be careful with coding this as to make sure there is always at least 1 valid card on screen
    -   Could use an object to store this?
    -   While function to check how many objects in the shuffled array are valid >= 1

Timed
- Every game mode has a timed option
- Different scoring storage
- Better for "prestige"
- Have to hold off on making this a pushed thing/faster until the time mechanism is fixed

useEffect with a setTimeout, and cancel setTimeout and restart it if a card is clicked

Fifty-Fifty
- Only two cards shown
- One will always be valid
- The more you click, the more you randomization in the invalid card

Blitz
- Faster timer
- Game will flip cards every few seconds
- You have to click as many in the time limit as possible

Speed up timer (only timed available)

Mixed fifty-fifty
- It may show you fifty fifty, or it may not. If it shows both that you have clicked before, you must not touch any of the cards. The timer will run out and you will move to the next cards


Secret levels:

Unown mode
-   Only unown pokemon are shown
-   Hardest difficulty?
