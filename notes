Thoughts:

App.jsx will be a component that renders the home page, where you can select the mode of the game. Once the mode of the game is selected, the game will render with a sub-component.

App.jsx will host an effect which retrieves the pokemon data from the API. First will be the first 151. This will store the data in a state.

The game will start based on a true/false state. Name yet to be determined.

Maybe a scoring function based on the max number of cards. i.e. if you have 20 cards max, remembering 5 will get a score of 100. If you get all 20, that's 400 points. Conversely, if you have 10 cards max, you can only ever get 100 points.

-   Not very fair, considering if you remember 10 cards out of 20 you get more than 10/10. It's harder, but not that much harder maybe?
-   Some form of scaling algorithm would be good
